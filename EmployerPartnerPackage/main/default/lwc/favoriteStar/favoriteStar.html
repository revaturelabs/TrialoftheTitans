    LWC for 'Favorite' funtionality, will be a button from 'utility' that depicts a star.
    Nested in Parent component: heroResultsComponent.html (inside LWC's {currentHeroes} for-loop)

    WORKING:
        Base functionality is implemented and working. This component involves a Boolean variable, favoriteState, which tracks state changes for each hero(user) object.
        Once this component is clicked, a success toast message appears informing Employer users of their favorite selection(s) being recognized and processed.
        Once this component is UNCLICKED, an informational toast message appears informing Employer users of their favorite de-selection(s) being recognized and processed.

        Can be found as an custom LWC inside the web-builder for Experience Cloud.
        Can also be found as an custom LWC inside Lightning App Buildier.
    
    
    TO-DO: Processing Favorites, combination of Salesforce administration + programming responsibilities.

        PROGRAMMATICALLY:
                        -Utilizing variable, currenthero, to successfully be passed parent, heroResultsComponent, iteration data to hold and be able to access all necessary hero
                            data.

                        -With the hero object data being inside currenthero -- either utilize an existing/or create an APEX class that will handle a DML insertion when a favorite is
                            clicked + recognized (hero object data will need to be seen by this apex class or vice-versa). Or if possible, just utilize JavaScript to do this.
                            Same thing will need to be done for UNFAVORITE funtionality -- utilizing APEX to remove this hero from an employer's favorite list.

                        -All functionality should be handled in method: handleFavoriteClick(). Helper methods are recommended for cleaner code.

                        -Uncomment & utilize favoriteToast() and unfavoriteToast() message variant to actually use hero data (possibly just the name) in display message.
                         Right now it is a default message to show user interaction success. Can delete this or just comment out.
        
    
        SF ADMINISTRATIVE WORK:
                        -Need to create an Employer user type. Was gonna base it off of the Hero user but with access to a custom object called FavoritesList.

                        -Make sure Employer user has access to all APEX classes -- should follow the same steps as setting up a Titan and Hero user.

                        -Setup up custom object FavoritesList, and - for now - only let the Employer have read/viewing access. Was thinking this will be a Lookup relationship on the
                         Employer(Contact object with Employer license).
                        
                        -Make sure all necessary DML events correctly insert or remove the favorited hero from the Employer's personal FavoritesList.
