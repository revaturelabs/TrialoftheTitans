# .auradoc  not implemented.  refer to https://trailblazer.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A00000159O6QAI to see why this wasn't implemented.  to give a synopsis as of 4 months ago
# this is a feature yet to be added to lwc's.  This leads me to believe it will become deprecated.
## I will refrain from reduntantly documenting this and will link this as a point of reference as to what can and cant be implemented from the aura component bundle in lwc

### since .design was left empty I decided it was uneccessary to fill in any file here.
### same with the .css
### I've also noticed that a lot of the functionality here is gimped.  Not sure if it's within my spex to fix the issues but it's worth documenting it.
### for example, the event handler exists for no real reason, some vars exist for no real reason(not really ever used), etc.
