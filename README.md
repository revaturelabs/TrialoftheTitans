## Overview
### Description
Trial of Titans is a gamified Learning Management System where users are able to progress through different topics and ultimately face a final challenge. Users are known as 'Hero's who are guided by their 'Oracle' trainers. To conquer a 'Titan', i.e. a technology, the hero must face a series of 'Minions' which are Titan related sub skills. Eventually, the hero is met with a final challenge that allows them to conquer the Titan.
